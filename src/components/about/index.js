              Hello and well met! My name is Kyleah Justice and I am newly branded Full-Stack Web Developer.I graduated from the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp
              in February of 2022. I have worked on several different challenges and projects, each using a new or combination of technologies, libraries, and
              coding languages. As I move continue on this adventure of Coding, I hope to improve in every way. I'm constantly looking at others code or searching
              google for the best ways to implement technologies or organizing my own code. I'd like to continue to build these skills and discover a career in this 
              field, as I know it's something I'm becoming very passionate about, and that's the best kind of career. I hope to meet and work with others so we can 
              create something incredible.
            </p>
